(see section 7,9,11,12 of https://happygitwithr.com/)\n\nGithub classrooms\nEven if you use the github classroom web api, you may want to install Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel and colleagues’ excellent ghclass package.\nAndrew used it to manage the class:\nSet up team assignments\nPush edits to existing assignments\nClone all student repos for grading, branching, and other housekeeping\nUnwatch student repos, so you aren’t buried in github spam whenever your students make commits\nBranch against the initial commit (useful for grading via pull requests)\nAt some point, I will post excerpts from the script I used to manage assignments.\nGrading with github classrooms\nYou can use pull requests, but you’ll need to make sure you have a branch created against the initial commit.\n(See previous bullet). Although you can do this post-hoc, life will be easier if you do it ahead of time.\nI could not figure out a good way to collaborate with TAs in the grading without sending the students (pre-mature and possibly incorrect) feedback. Basically, a way to mute a pull request before it’s submitted would be useful.\n\n\n\n",
