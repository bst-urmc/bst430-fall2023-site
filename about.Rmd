```


## Rstudio 

1. Sign-up for a GitHub account. Install R, RStudio, and GIT on your computer.
2. Students will need to load their GIT config in RStudio. (see section 7,9,11,12 of https://happygitwithr.com/)
<!-- 3. Students need to delete their cloned directories manually between RStudio sessions. -->

<!-- ## Rstudio cloud -->

<!-- 1. Sign-up for a rstudio cloud account and a github account. -->
<!-- 2.  Students will need to link their rstudio cloud account to github and enable private repos.  RSC is good about prompting for when attempting to create a project from a private repo. -->
<!-- 3.  Less obviously, you will need to enable 3rd-party API access from the GH classroom organization.  Note that I don't entirely understand the security implications, rstudio probably should find a way to invite access via the github API rather than requiring carte blanche access. -->
<!-- 4.  Students don't have a class workspace on RSC this year, their default (free) workspaces will eventually run out of compute... -->
<!-- 5.  It's amazing how much compute your class will burn.  The calculated usage seemed to be about 2x what students self-reported that their homework took.  I only had 9 students, and don't know if it would be tenable to use RSC in a larger classroom. -->
<!-- (This is part of why we're not using it this year.) -->

## Github classrooms
 
Even if you use the github classroom web api, you may want to install Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel and colleagues' excellent [ghclass](https://rundel.github.io/ghclass/articles/articles/ghclass.html) package.  

Andrew used it to manage the class:

*  Set up team assignments
*  Push edits to existing assignments
*  Clone all student repos for grading, branching, and other housekeeping
*  Unwatch student repos, so you aren't buried in github spam whenever your students make commits
*  Branch against the initial commit (useful for grading via pull requests)

At some point, I will post excerpts from the script I used to manage assignments.

### Grading with github classrooms

You can use pull requests, but you'll need to make sure you have a branch created against the initial commit.
(See previous bullet).  Although you can do this post-hoc, life will be easier if you do it ahead of time.
I could not figure out a good way to collaborate with TAs in the grading without sending the students (pre-mature and possibly incorrect) feedback.  Basically, a way to mute a pull request before it's submitted would be useful.
